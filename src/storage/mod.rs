//! Core abstractions and implementation for data storage.
//!
//! This module defines the core traits and types for managing data storage within Cryo,
//! including the [`StorageEngine`] trait, which outlines how storage backends interact with
//! the rest of the system.
//!
//! It also includes concrete storage implementations, such as a BTree backend, and
//! structures for representing persistent data (e.g., pages and rows) both in memory and on disk.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Cryoâ€™s storage layer is designed to be modular and extensible. At the heart of this
//! module is the [`StorageEngine`] trait, which defines a consistent interface for
//! executing DSL-level operations like inserts, reads, and deletes, regardless of the
//! underlying storage format.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`StorageEngine`]: A trait that defines high-level operations (`select`, `insert`, `delete`) on a storage engine.
//! - [`Row`]: A record stored inside a page; has an in-memory and binary representation.
//!
//! # In-Memory vs On-Disk Representation
//!
//! - **In-memory**: Data structures like `Row` and `Page` are represented using rich types (`Vec<u8>`, structs) for ergonomic and efficient access.
//! - **On-disk**: Pages are serialized into a compact binary format, including metadata like offsets and lengths. `Row` structures are encoded into byte sequences stored inside pages.
//!
//! # See Also
//! - [`statement`](crate::statement): Frontend statements that are evaluated by a storage engine.
